# Automated Visual Defect Detection System

This project implements an automated visual defect detection system for manufacturing assembly lines using deep learning. The system can detect various types of defects such as scratches, cracks, and misprints in real-time.

## Features

- Real-time defect detection using deep learning
- Support for multiple defect types
- Transfer learning using pre-trained models
- Fast inference (< 1 second per image)
- Visualization of detected defects
- Configurable confidence thresholds
- Detailed logging and reporting

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/defect-detection.git
cd defect-detection
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Training

To train the model on your dataset:

```bash
python src/train.py --data_dir dataset/ --model resnet50 --epochs 50
```

### Running the Demo

To run real-time defect detection:

```bash
python demo.py --model models/best_model.pth --camera 0  # For webcam
python demo.py --model models/best_model.pth --input path/to/image  # For single image
```

### Evaluation

To evaluate the model's performance:

```bash
python evaluate.py --model models/best_model.pth --test_dir dataset/test
```

## Model Architecture

The system uses a ResNet50 backbone pre-trained on ImageNet, fine-tuned for defect detection. The architecture includes:
- Transfer learning from pre-trained weights
- Custom classification head for defect/no-defect prediction
- Optional feature pyramid network for better small defect detection

## Performance Metrics

- Inference time: < 1 second per image
- Accuracy: ~95% (varies by defect type)
- False Positive Rate: < 5%
- False Negative Rate: < 2%

## Handling False Positives/Negatives

The system implements several strategies to minimize false positives and negatives:
1. Confidence thresholding with configurable values
2. Ensemble predictions over multiple frames
3. Post-processing filters for noise reduction
4. Two-stage verification for high-confidence defects
